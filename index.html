“Judging others makes us blind, whereas love is illuminating. <br>
By judging others we blind ourselves to our own evil and to the grace which others are just as entitled to as we are.” <br>
	<i> How do we change our impulsive nature to judge one another upon first meeting to be filled with love and acceptance instead? </i>

Why do we tend to hurt the ones closest to us? Why is it that much too often, the one we hurt the most is ourself?

Your word is the power that you have to create. Your word is the gift that comes directly from God. The Gospel of John in the Bible, speaking of the creation of the universe, says, <br>
“In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word is God.” <br>
Through the word you express your creative power. <br>
It is through the word that you manifest everything. Regardless of what language you speak, your intent manifests through the word. <br>
What you dream, what you feel, and what you really are, will all be manifested through the word.	<br><br>
	The word is truly a <i>force</i>. What will you do with it?

<i> How does one’s individuality thrive in a culture that is fertile grounds for shame? Must I hide every piece of me until my reflection is of someone else entirely? </i>

when i love, i tend to give it my all <br>
sometimes my all means giving pieces of myself that weren’t meant to be given away <br>
to people who don’t deserve it, who won’t accept it and who weren’t willing to give it back <br>
but today, for the first time in a very long time... i finally feel free <br>
i feel whole again, yet lighter than before <br>
it is a foreign feeling but i hope it stays <br>
sometimes we must lose ourselves to find ourselves again, not unchanged but changed for the better <br>
thank you for showing me the way.
