fashion for a woman still predominates how people view you. <br>
that's not fair and that's not right but it's true. <br>
and that's when fashion isn't just fashion- it's how you turn it into your tool rather than be a victim to it 	<br>

We live in a society that attempts to deny death. <br>
Although we know everything is impermanent, we want permanence, we expect it <br>
Our natural tendency is to seek security:<br>
We do not like chance. <br>
We do not like that our bodies change shape.<br>
We do not like that we age. <br>
We are not wary of wrinkles.<br>
And most notably, we are afraid of the unknown death brings. <br>

if we stopped talking, would it also feel like a piece of your world is missing? <br>
like a jigsaw puzzle that is nearly complete <br>
would you stop and wonder why <br>
words that were once there <br>
has lost its beat?<br>

but i can't help wondering if life would be easier somewhere else, <br>
maybe life isn't easier anywhere right now <br>
maybe life isn't easier anywhere, ever

"If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, <br>
and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them.  <br>
But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being	<br>
And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"

“Judging others makes us blind, whereas love is illuminating. <br>
By judging others we blind ourselves to our own evil and to the grace which others are just as entitled to as we are.” <br>

Your word is the power that you have to create. Your word is the gift that comes directly from God. The Gospel of John in the Bible, speaking of the creation of the universe, says, <br>
“In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word is God.” <br>
Through the word you express your creative power. <br>
It is through the word that you manifest everything. Regardless of what language you speak, your intent manifests through the word. <br>
What you dream, what you feel, and what you really are, will all be manifested through the word.	<br><br>
	The word is truly a <i>force</i>. What will you do with it?

<i> How does one’s individuality thrive in a culture that is fertile grounds for shame? Must I hide every piece of me until my reflection is of someone else entirely? </i>

when i love, i tend to give it my all <br>
sometimes my all means giving pieces of myself that weren’t meant to be given away <br>
to people who don’t deserve it, who won’t accept it and who weren’t willing to give it back <br>
but today, for the first time in a very long time... i finally feel free <br>
i feel whole again, yet lighter than before <br>
it is a foreign feeling but i hope it stays <br>
sometimes we must lose ourselves to find ourselves again, not unchanged but changed for the better <br>
thank you for showing me the way.
